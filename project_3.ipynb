By adding a \"wealth\" vector (isolated by subtracting \"poor\" from \"rich\") to words like \"teacher,\" \"city,\" or \"car,\" the model may associate these terms with wealth-related concepts, potentially showing biases about socioeconomic status. For exmaple: Adding the \"wealth\" vector to \"teacher\" result in associations that lean toward higher-paying or prestigious occupations, suggesting assumptions about wealthier professions.

Some partnerships are and could be weaker links, which is why we ask, what is the point of the partnership in the first place?

But there needs to be a contractual agreement that the institution will only fund those 5 things. The 6th, providing weapons to Israel, will be unacceptable. I understand that in this day and age, it is difficult to completely divest from corporations that supply other countries, regardless of if you agree with their policies or not.

(Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

This is necessarily  still a useful, likely is the best definition because it is the definition used by Netanyahu, Ben Gvir, and the Likud party.  As recently as this week they have shown maps showing their plans to seize the entire west bank for permanent Israeli settlement in full, and their language towards gaza has been of how to evict them so that israeli settlers can begin moving in.  That is practical, actual, in effect, real zionism in action.  That is what protesters are specifically talking about.  If we are attempting to be most understanding, a sticker like in the OP would be referring to the zionist soldiers who maybe killed a family member of theirs during one of the many mass evictions, much in the way a colonial american might have said \"Death to Redcoats!\".  Of course, too many people also use the phrase to mean \"average person who supports zionism but isnt actually firing the guns or passing the laws\" which is a problem, our whole goal in this discussion is to think how best we can get to a scenario where apartheid is over and civilians can live in peace regardless of their prior beliefs.

It is normal for definitions to change with time (Republicans love talking about how they were the party of Lincoln despite the modern Republican party aligning more with the Democratic Party of that era), and by 1949, political zionism shifted considerably. Modern Israel was formed not as an ethnostate, but as a multicultural and mostly secular state with the state religion being Judaism. It’s similar to any European Christian country with a state church but one that also has a diverse population and allows anyone to serve in government/have any occupation independent of religion or ethnic background. Israel is actually the most religiously diverse country in the region, despite ~70% being Jewish. That composition is not consistent with an ethnostate, which would be something like Japan, China, or even the population of Gaza which is >98% Sunni Muslim.

Bibi is attempting to conflate his version of zionism with all zionism and further with all judaism such that he and his supporters can call anyone who criticizes him antisemitic, that if you ask him to stop killing children he can say you hate jews.  It is their stated goal and why they are pushing so hard to redefine words in their favor.  There is a reason Israel is the only foreign nation where US states will pass laws banning people from NOT working with them.  Bibi's brand wants to conflate political ideology with ethnicity and religion until they are inextricable. The tangible effect of that also goes in reverse, now anti jewish racists of both the classic nazi variety and also the modern anti israel variety attack random jewish people because they see them as representative of bibi brand zionism even though they are not - which is complicated when Bibi's brand of zionism will claim that they are.  Conflating an ethnicity with a political state is one of the most racist things you can do and Bibi brand zionism does it to itself.

I regularly see social media posts where someone is pinging a business, like an airline, trying to get a flight attendant wearing a palestinian flag pin fired for being antisemitic, some airlines have even bent to that pressure. It's a horrifying loop that US liberals are engaging in that plays directly into the hands of Bibi brand zionism and strengthens it, not weakens it.\n",

You can't judge them for saying the word using your definition when they are using it for their definition.  Rather than fight over the semantics of what words are and aren't allowed at a protest, perhaps a better option is to actually engage with the protesters and what their goals are.    At this point 8/10 democrats want to stop sending weapons to Israel, I believe it may even be a majority of americans total.  Not because they are antisemitic, not because they support hamas, but because Bibi brand zionism is genocidal, and he is using the lives of jewish people who are not his brand of zionism as a shield to protect himself, and the protest movement wants him to stop and just like the protesters in tel aviv who got skunk gassed, they want a ceasefire now.  Bibi does not want a ceasefire.  Nobody has any leverage over him except Biden and american businesses.  So it is our job to find a way to make that pressure effective.  And tone policing antiwar protests rather than, you know, joining them until the war stops, is not going to be effective.\n",

Trump does seem to be more blindly pro-Israel than Harris - but, even if you do genuinely believe they are both equal on the issue, I find it likely that, if you're pro-Palestine, you're also in support of other issues (such as abortion rights, and/or LGBTQIA+ rights, and/or freedom of speech and/or religion) that you're more likely to vote for Harris than Trump on. It also sounds like you voted in the Democratic primary, so I'm guessing you tend to vote more Democratic than Republican. If I'm right about any of this, meaning that you probably would have voted for Harris if not for her Israel-Palestine stance (which you think Trump is equally bad for), voting for nobody is essentially taking away a vote from Harris. It's not like neither of them will win as a result of your voting uncommitted - it's that Trump is ever so slightly more likely to win. And if you genuinely have no preference between the two of them, well, I disagree with you, but you'll at least be voting your conscience. But, if that's not the case, and you do have some slight preference for one candidate over the other, then your not voting is really just taking away a vote for the candidate that you'd like to win. Even if they do notice that a lot of people have voted uncommitted over Palestine, what then? Either Harris wins, in which case, if you're right that all she cares about is the votes, it doesn't matter whether or not you voted uncommitted - or, Trump wins, in which case Trump is president and also Harris has less direct power to take action over that issue, especially after January. Maybe, in four years, if she or someone else runs again, and if they're convinced by this election, and if the situation persists, they could take action on it then - but wouldn't things be even more irrevocable at that point?\n",

I also voted uncommitted because there was no candidate who stood a chance of winning that primary that I would be substantially more unhappy with than any other candidate. I will not vote uncommitted in the general election (which I also believe was the larger uncommitted voter movement's official stance at the time - I seem to remember them encouraging people to vote for Biden in the general election still over Trump, though I could well be misremembering).

I fully get the sentiment that politicians should be the ones who have to win over our votes, because that definitely *should* be the case. However, the fact is that my vote still holds some small amount of power; and, even if I wish Harris would have to work harder to earn my vote, the fact that she currently doesn't doesn't absolve me of any responsibility from how I'm voting, and whatever (admittedly small) amount of impact it can and will have.

Polling opened for the regents at approximately 3:40pm on Saturday, and was open for around an hour. After polls closed, no update was given on the process until around 5:20, when it was announced that votes were still being counted. The next update was at around 5:50, ten minutes before the convention was scheduled to end, where an announcer said that the votes had been counted, and now the calculations had begun (votes are weighted by county in a process that was not and has not been completely disclosed to the public). Around this time, there were reports of several cop cars around the convention center, and multiple cops came inside to “make sure delegates left peacefully after the results were announced”. Finally, the announcer came back out on stage over an hour later (and an hour after the convention had ended) and announced the final tallies for each candidate, said that Illitch and Diggs won, then hurried off backstage.

            "1. This resume kind of screams master of game dev. Assuming you're not applying for game dev roles (and considering you've sent 700+ apps I assume not), this resume is still way too focused on game dev. It's unclear what roles you're targeting (backend/frontend/fullstack/ml/etc.) You don't have to have a speciality or anything, but a kind of broad direction is good. Fullstack + ML? Frontend? etc. This again is indicated by the projects you choose to display & the bullets you use to highlight exp. You have 2 game dev projects + bullets that kind of seem, all over the place? You have 1 frontend exp + 2 game dev + 1 AR + 2 game dev projects. I'm not really sure what to get from this. If you're not targeting game dev roles I would replace your projects and select your bullets for those exps better. For example, pioneered an accessible, flexible, game engine\" is a good first bullet because it's broad enough, but the rest are useless. \"Developed 2d+ shaders\", \"Implemented A\\* pathfinding\", \"Engineered a scalable, modular enemy wave system\", \"Created RPG, RTS, and Tower Defense templates\" are frankly not good bullet points if you're not game dev. If a role is hiring for Backend SWE I don't care about any of the above. You're highlighting the wrong parts of your experience. Did you work in a team? Use cloud services? Highlight other parts of what you did. Same goes with bunch of bullets under other exp.\n",
            "2. The other glaring issue is that your bullet points don't follow STAR. Firstly, I don't see a single metric/result/statistic anywhere in your resume which is definitely not helping you pass screens. Secondly, I don't see the point in some of your bullets. For example, \"Streamlined source control via Bitbucket while engaging in global communication and collaboration\" is a really weak bullet among several. Another example is, \"Created responsive particle systems for an immersive experience, consistently testing to ensure functionality\". This barely tells me anything, and \"consistently testing to ensure functionality\" is not really something to be highlighting in your resume either. I would suggest cutting this and replacing it with something else altogether, or even a stronger rephrasing might be something like \"Integrated responsive particle systems using React, Node.js, [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) to enhance user experience, resulting in 50% increase in interaction rates\" or something. You want all your bullets to follow the format of \"Developed \\[xyz\\] to accomplish \\[xyz\\] using \\[x, y, z\\], resulting in \\[xyz\\]\".\n",

The upcoming fall semester is also my 5th year (9th semester) at UMich. I am an international student who first came to UMich back in fall 2018. Up until first semester of sophomore year, I was maintaining 3.5 gpa, but during the winter 2020 semester when COVID happened, I was not able to focus on classes because of remote learning and ended up with multiple C's which were all luckily masked with P's, so no damage was done to my cgpa. Then I took 2 years of gap year to go back to my country for mandatory military service. I came back fall 2022 semester, but I was seriously burned out from serving and also getting back to an academic setting was very difficult transition for me. Although I was barely able to get above 3.00 gpa that semester, subsequent semesters I got below 3.00 gpa, and, ultimately, I got below 2.00 gpa the past winter semester, resulting in me being placed in academic probation. Back then, I would be upset with getting B's but now I don't really care even when I get C's and D's. I would also feel really anxious back then when I missed quizzes that didn't count towards final grades, but now I dont really give a shit about missing exams and quizzes (in fact I skipped all exams for one particular class and ended up with an E). I feel extremely devastated, and I have occasional lingering suicidal thoughts because of how much I screwed up college. I had nearly no friends throughout college and was never, ever socially active. I feel like crap when students around me are seemingly doing well academically and being active socially/making great college memories while I am stuck in my room most of the times not being able to focus on studying, wasting time on the internet, etc. My parents never know how much I am struggling in college, and I feel extemely guilty because they spent around $300k to send me here to study. I don't know how I can get out from this mess I've created and feel extremely angry/remorseful of all the wasted time and money the past six years.

For example, the student legal services fees go to that office to fund their work.  As for tuition, that gets split between all the units where a student takes classes--so if a Social Work student takes a class in LSA and another in the Law school, LSA & Law each get some of the tuition the Social work student is charged.  So if Social Work hires one of their student to be a GSI, they can't just say \"oh, we'll just waive your tuition & fees and not collect the revenue\" because it's not all their revenue to forego.  They'd be taking revenue away from student legal services, from Law, from LSA, each of whom aren't gaining anything from the hire.  So the correct way to handle this is that the grad student gets charged tuition, and SSW pays it as part of the GSI package, and it all flows to units as planned.\n",

            "Error processing text: TLDR: Yes, the GSI selection criteria is opaque and there can be politics involved. Yes, sometimes the students that work hardest do not get the position while for some the opportunity drops into their lap without much effort. For better or worse, the GSI system is the way it is because the skills needed for the position are not the same as the ones required for being a good student or researcher. Soft skills are be vital and for small courses having a pre-existing rapport with the instructor matter as it helps the course operate more smoothly. Finally, the GSI positions are never guaranteed unless you are a PhD student and being a GSI a necessity for your funding. As others pointed out, keep working hard and eventually your efforts will be rewarded whether it is a GSI position with tuition waiver, a high paying industry job, or a good post-doc/tenure track position that fits your interests.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **For better or worse, the politics are a necessary component of the process as in smaller/advanced courses**, GSIs are mostly autonomous and design the labs on their own. An instructor needs to be able to get along with the GSI, trust in their abilities, and be able to rely on them during emergencies (ex: professor is sick and needs someone to teach a class under short notice). It is not uncommon to see a professors own students get GSI positions for their class as usually the research areas overlap (i.e., if a student is focusing on experimental design and working with a professor working on experimental design, they might be shortlisted and given preference to teach an experimental design course). Furthermore, some professors want to keep the same GSI for the course to make the process easy or reward hard work (example: GSIs that design labs for a course might be preferred to give the course consistency and reward hard work of the GSI)\n",
            "2. **Soft skills are as important as hard skills for GSI positions.** GSIs teach material, head discussions, grade assignments, and are usually required to communicate with students. Under these circumstances, sometimes soft skills can take precedence over hard skills. You might outperform your peers in courses, in your research, and other fields but if they are better communicators, especially verbal communicators, they might be chosen over you as a GSI since depending on the course, most of the position is communicating. This is another reason why not every researcher makes a good instructor and vice versa. Some people are naturally better at explaining complicated concepts simply or captivate a room full of students or not loose their temper when students ask the same question 1000th time in the same office hour instead of paying attention to other students' questions. These skills can be acquired through practice, but just like sports there are some who are natural at this.\n",
            "3.  (**I am not sure if the OP is a masters or a PhD student) GSI positions are not a right, they are a privilege unless you are PhD student**. In US universities master's programs are usually cash-cows where students pay for a education credential, this is in contrast with Europe where master's programs are usually research focused, akin to first 2 years of a PhD program in US. Since master's programs generate revenue, most programs do not give GSI positions to master's students if they can help it. (GSI=tuition waiver=loss of tuition revenue). PhD students already have their education paid for so a tuition waiver is not a loss of revenue and depending on the department, most PhD students are required to GSI for a set number of semesters per their funding offer. Some get fellowships and GSRA positions instead of GSI positions but most are required to GSI. The specifics change between fields and departments but the point stands that PhD students have priority for GSI positions and they also have 1-on-1 relationship with professors as their advisors, committee members, co-authors etc. as such will always be in a better place to snatch the open positions\n",

It is a niche major (you are still a math major technically it is a concentration) but has a wide range of possible career prospects, with the most lucrative being quant finance where some get 6 figure salaries right out of college. Finally, the major has a lot of overlap with statistics (entire statistics pre-requisite and 425-426 theory requirement for statistics) and somewhat with economics (you need to take econ 101-02 and can count 401-402 distributional electives for the major) so double or even triple majoring is quite easy.

Just to take MATH 423, a course primarily on pricing options, you need Math 115,116,215,217 and 425. Furthermore, most of your coursework is theoretical. This is somewhat an artefact of quantitative finance where the models are continuously refined (for example a ARMA-GARCH model with asymmetric and heavy tailed error distribution would be a considered simple even though non of the components of the model are trivial, especially estimation) and the field is very top heavy with a lot of math geniuses (ex: students taking PhD level coursework sophomores/juniors) or PhD holders dominating the field. This makes going through the AMDP track a near necessity if you want to go forward with a quant position in the industry. Finally, like all other math tracks, the coursework can get time consuming and difficult at times with a lot of variance due to most courses (in the math department, not the electives/requirements from other departments) being taught by post-docs that are here for 2-3 years (I had one or two courses during my entire major that were from full time faculty, rest were all post-docs). \n",

The major has nice exits in terms of AMDP programs or industry but the coursework is really theoretical so you need internships or other advanced courses to supplement yourself in terms of applied skills. Finally, the coursework can be difficult but if you put time and effort to it you can succeed!

So many kids are stuck in situations where their parents income holds them back from getting grants but the parents won’t support them even though they are the single defining factor for if they can afford school or not.
